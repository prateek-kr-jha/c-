c++ = c + OOPs
used where high performance and precise control over memory is required.


### writing c++ code:
- step 1: define problem
- step 2: design a solution
- step 3: write a program
- step 4: compile the program
- step 5: link object files
- step 6: test program

compiling: 
- checks code to make sure it follows the rules of the c++ code.
- converts code to machine level language and outputs a *.o/obj file

linking:
- linker's job is to combine all obj files and produce desired o/p file
- read all .obj file's and make sure they are valid.
- ensures all cross-file dependencies are resolved properly. if linker is unable to connect a reference to something with its definition, you'll get linker error.
- linker also links library files.
- o/p a executable file.
